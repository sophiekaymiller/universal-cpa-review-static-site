An Affiliate Program allows you to place links to our products on your web site. After placing these links, visitors to your site have the opportunity to buy products. If a product is purchased by one of your visitors through our web sites, we pay you a commission for each sale.

It is totally free to join our Affiliate Program. There is no charge to apply and there is no minimum sales requirement.

Please email Joseph Reeve at Joseph@universalcpareview.com for all affiliate related inquiries.
